I decided to make a website dedicated to one of my favourite movies. This website includes a home page with a summary, and 4 other pages:
-The vision (Director's vision while making final cut, and a embeded video)
-Fun Facts (Some facts about Apocalypse Now)
-Gallery (A gallery page illustrating some of the most iconic moments in the movie)
-Awards (A table including all the nominations and awards the movie collected)

I used semantic elements for better Search engine optimization such as "header", "section", "nav", "footer", "main", "aside".
All pages include a responsive navbar and a footer.
For the positioning, I almost always used Flexbox and some margins and paddings.

MAKING IT RESPONSIVE:

The main thing I used to make the website responsive is the "@mediascreen and (max-width: xxx)" rule. 
This way I could make sure that all the content fits up until the smallest screens at 375px.
For different sizes:
I used flexbox to change the flex direction (ex: row to column) of the different sections of the website, and changed a few margins or paddings as well as font sizes.
I used classes to affect different elements seperately. For instance in the first page, to reverse the flex on certain elements
so that they would properly fold in order to be responsive.

For the navbar: I used a dropdown menu that appears when the size of the display is smaller than 1200px. I used favicons instead of the checkboxes to make it look better.
These checknoxes allow the user to see the nav links whenever they check the box.
